# 10001st prime

# By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
#
# What is the 10 001st prime number?

"""
Solution Approach
=================
* Iterate infinitely from 2 and check each number is prime
* if the number is prime, then increment a counter (initiated to 1, earlier)
* else move on to next number
* Break the loop if the desired counter is reached
